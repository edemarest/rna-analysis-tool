RNA Sequence Analysis Tool

Overview
This tool allows users to upload RNA sequences and perform various functions on them. It supports both single and multiple sequence analyses, providing clear and digestible results and statistics. The functions include sequence statistics, nucleotide frequencies, GC content distribution, and more. The results are displayed with visualizations and organized data for easy interpretation.

Features
- **Upload RNA sequences**: Upload your own sequence data for analysis.
- **Sequence statistics**: Get basic statistics such as average length, nucleotide counts, and GC content distribution.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to help visualize sequence characteristics such as length distribution and nucleotide frequency.
- **Multiple sequence analysis**: Compare multiple sequences for comparative analysis.
- **Clear results**: Results are displayed in an easy-to-read table format with visualizations.

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repo-url>

2. Install the required dependencies:
   npm install

3. Run the application:
   npm start

Usage
1. Upload an RNA sequence file (in FASTA format).
2. Select the function you want to perform on the sequence (e.g., sequence statistics, motif search).
3. View the results, which will include key statistics and visualizations of your data.
